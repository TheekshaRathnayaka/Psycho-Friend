<h2>Depression</h2>
<p>Depression may be described as feeling sad, blue, unhappy, miserable, or down in the
dumps. Most of us feel this way at one time or another for short periods. Clinical depression
is a mood disorder in which feelings of sadness, loss, anger, or frustration interfere with
everyday life for weeks or more. Depression can occur in people of all ages.</p>
<ul>
Symptoms of depression: 
<li>Low mood or irritable mood most of the time</li>
<li>Trouble sleeping or sleeping too much</li>
<li>A big change in appetite, often with weight gain or loss</li>
<li>Tiredness and lack of energy</li>
<li>Feelings of worthlessness, self-hate, and guilt</li>
<li>Difficulty concentrating</li>
<li>Slow or fast movements</li>
<li>Lack of activity and avoiding usual activities</li>
<li>Feeling hopeless or helpless</li>

</ul>
<ul>
In adults, life changes can increase the risk for depression. Some of these changes are,
<li>A move from home</li>
<li>Chronic illness or pain</li>
<li>Children moving away</li>
<li>Close friends passing away</li>
<li>Loss of independence (for example, problems getting around or caring for oneself, or loss of driving privileges)</li>
<li>Relationship breakup</li>
<li>Failure in examinations </li>
<li>Personality disorders</li>
</ul>
<p>Depression can also be related to physical illnesses, such as thyroid disorders,
Parkinson disease, heart disease, cancer, stroke, dementia (such as Alzheimer disease) and
overuse of alcohol or certain medicines (such as sleep aids) can make depression worse.</p>
