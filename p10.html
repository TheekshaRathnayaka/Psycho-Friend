<h2>Self-harm</h2>
<p>Self-harm, or self-injury, is when a person hurts his or her own body on purpose. The 
injuries may be minor, but sometimes they can be severe. They may leave permanent scars or 
cause serious health problems. Some examples are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cutting yourself (such as using a razor blade, knife, or other sharp object to cut your skin)</li>
<li>Punching yourself or punching things (like a wall)</li>
<li>Burning yourself with cigarettes, matches, or candles</li>
<li>Pulling out your hair</li>
<li>Poking objects through body openings</li>
<li>Breaking your bones or bruising yourself</li>
</ul>
<p>Self-harm is not a mental disorder. It is a behavior - an unhealthy way to cope with 
strong feelings. However, some of the people who harm themselves do have a mental disorder.
 But they are at higher risk of attempting suicide if they do not get help.</p>
<ul>They harm themselves to try to:
<li>Make themselves feel something, when they feel empty or numb inside</li>
<li>Block upsetting memories</li>
<li>Show that they need help</li>
<li>Release strong feelings that overwhelm them, such as anger, loneliness, or hopelessness</li>
<li>Punish themselves</li>
<li>Feel a sense of control</li>
</ul>
<ul>Self-harm is more common in people who:
<li>Were abused or went through a trauma as children</li>
<li>Have mental disorders, such as</li>
<ul>
<li>Depression </li>
<li>Eating disorders </li>
<li>Post-traumatic stress disorder </li>
<li>Certain personality disorders </li>
</ul>
<li>Misuse drugs or alcohol</li>
<li>Have friends who self-harm</li>
<li>Have low self-esteem</li>
</ul>
<ul>Signs that someone may be hurting themselves include:
<li>Having frequent cuts, bruises, or scars</li>
<li>Wearing long sleeves or pants even in hot weather</li>
<li>Making excuses about injuries</li>
<li>Having sharp objects around for no clear reason</li>
</ul>
