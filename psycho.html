<p>
The term psychopathology can also refer to the manifestation of a psychological disorder.
A psychological disorder is, broadly, a condition characterized by distressing, impairing,
and/or atypical thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Identifying what kinds of thoughts,
feelings, and behaviors are signs of psychological disorders or are atypical is extremely
important for mental health. <br><br>
A person who feels compelled to wash their hands 40 times per day or a person who claims to
hear the voices of demons would regard as atypical and impairing, if not distressing. But,
if someone may feel nervousness when giving a speech or the loneliness a freshman may
experience during the first semester of college, these feelings are not unusual. <br><br>
The simplest way to identify psychological disorders is to label behaviors, thoughts, and
inner experiences that are atypical, distressful, dysfunctional, and sometimes even
dangerous to self or others as signs of a disorder.  If you felt extremely depressed, so
that you lost interest in activities, had difficulty eating or sleeping, felt utterly worthless,
and contemplated suicide; your feelings would be atypical, would deviate from the norm, and
could signify the presence of a psychological disorder. Just because something is atypical,
however, does not necessarily mean it is disordered. But it is better to focus on you.<br><br>
