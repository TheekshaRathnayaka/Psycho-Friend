<h2>Schizophrenia</h2>
<p>Schizophrenia is a serious brain illness. People who have it may hear voices that aren't
there. They may think other people are trying to hurt them. These include hallucinations
(hearing or seeing things that are not there), delusions (beliefs that are not true), 
trouble organizing thoughts, and strange movements. Sometimes they don't make sense when 
they talk. The disorder makes it hard for them to keep a job or take care of themselves.</p>
<ul>Symptoms of schizophrenia in teenagers are common for typical development during teen 
years, such as:
<li>Withdrawal from friends and family</li>
<li>A drop in performance at school</li>
<li>Trouble sleeping</li>
<li>Irritability or depressed mood</li>
<li>Lack of motivation</li>
</ul>
<ul>
No one is sure what causes schizophrenia. Your genes, environment, and brain chemistry may 
play a role. Situations that can cause Schizophrenia:
<li>Genetic factors ( Having a parent or sibling with schizophrenia puts the person at increased risk )</li>
<li>A chemical imbalance in the brain</li>
<li>Problems during pregnancy ( The child may develop schizophrenia if the mother does not receive proper nutrition, or is exposed to viral illnesses during pregnancy )</li>
<li>Bereavement</li>
<li>Losing your job or home</li>
<li>Divorce</li>
<li>The end of a relationship</li>
<li>Physical, sexual or emotional abuse</li>
<li>Misuse of drugs</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no cure. Medicine can help control many of the symptoms. You may need to try 
different medicines to see which works best. You should stay on your medicine for as long as
 your doctor recommends. Additional treatments can help you deal with your illness from day 
to day. These include therapy, family education, rehabilitation, and skills training.</p>
