<h2>Stress</h2>
<p>Stress is how your brain and body respond to a challenge or demand. When you are stressed,
 your body releases chemicals called hormones. The hormones make you alert and ready to 
act. They can raise your blood pressure, heart rate, and blood sugar levels. This response
 is sometimes called a "fight or flight" response.<br>
Everyone gets stressed from time to time. There are different types of stress. It can be
 short-term or long-term. It can be caused by something that happens once or something 
that keeps happening. Long-term stress, or chronic stress, lasts for weeks, months, or 
longer. As you go about your life, your body is acting as if you're being threatened. 
Causes of long-term stress include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Routine stress from the demands of work, school, family needs, money problems, and 
other daily pressures that don't stop.</li>
<li>Stress from sudden, difficult changes in your life, such as divorce, illness, losing
 your job, or other unhappy life events that often have a long impact.</li>
<li>Traumatic stress, which may happen when you're in danger of serious harm or death. 
Examples include being in a bad accident, a war, a flood, earthquake, or other frightening
 event. This type of stress can cause a long-lasting problem called post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).</li>
</ul>

<ul>People respond to stress in different ways. If you're stressed for a long time you 
may notice that you are:
<li>Getting sick more often than usual because stress weakens your body's ability to fight germs</li>
<li>Having stomach problems (digesting food)</li>
<li>Having trouble sleeping </li>
<li>Having headaches </li>
<li>Feeling sad, angry, or easily upset</li>
</ul>
<p>It's possible to get used to the symptoms of stress and not even realize there's a 
problem. So when there's a lot of stress in your life, it's important to pay attention 
to how it affects you so you can do something about it.</p>
