<h2>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</h2>
<p>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a mental disorder in which you have thoughts
(obsessions) and rituals (compulsions) over and over. They interfere with your life, but you
cannot control or stop them. The cause of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is unknown.
Factors such as genetics, brain biology and chemistry, and your environment may play a role.
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) usually begins when you are a teen or young adult.
People with OCD may have symptoms of obsessions, compulsions, or both.</p>
<ul>
Obsessions are repeated thoughts, urges, or mental images that cause anxiety.
They may involve things such as:
<li>Fear of germs or contamination</li>
<li>Fear of losing or misplacing something</li>
<li>Worries about harm coming towards yourself or others</li>
<li>Unwanted forbidden thoughts involving sex or religion</li>
<li>Aggressive thoughts towards yourself or others</li>
<li>Needing things lined up exactly or arranged in a particular, precise way</li>
</ul>
<ul>
Compulsions are behaviors that you feel like you need to do over and over to try to reduce
your anxiety or stop the obsessive thoughts. Some common compulsions include:
<li>Excessive cleaning or hand washing</li>
<li>Repeatedly checking on things, such as whether the door is locked or the oven is off</li>
<li>Compulsive counting</li>
<li>Ordering and arranging things in a particular, precise way</li>
</ul>
