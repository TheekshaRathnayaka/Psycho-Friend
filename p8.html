<h2>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</h2>
<p>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health disorder that some people develop
after they experience or see a traumatic event. The traumatic event may be life-threatening,
such as combat, a natural disaster, a car accident, or sexual assault. But sometimes the
event is not necessarily a dangerous one. For example, the sudden, unexpected death of a
loved one can also cause PTSD.
It's normal to feel afraid during and after a traumatic situation. This is your body's way
of helping to protect itself from possible harm. It causes changes in your body such as the
release of certain hormones and increases in alertness, blood pressure, heart rate, and breathing.<br>
In time, most people recover from this naturally. But people with PTSD don't feel better.
They feel stressed and frightened long after the trauma is over. In some cases, the PTSD
symptoms may start later on. They might also come and go over time. Genetics, neurobiology,
risk factors, and personal factors may affect whether you get PTSD after a traumatic event.</p>
<ul>
There are four types of PTSD symptoms, but they may not be the same for everyone. Each
person experiences symptoms in their own way.
Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD):<br>
<li>Re-experiencing symptoms, where something reminds you of the trauma and you feel that
fear again. Examples include:</li>
<ul>
<li>Flashbacks, which cause you to feel like you are going through the event again</li>
<li>Nightmares</li>
<li>Frightening thoughts</li>
</ul><br>
<li>Avoidance symptoms, where you try to avoid situations or people that trigger memories of
the traumatic event. This may cause you to:</li>
<ul>
<li>Stay away from places, events, or objects that are reminders of the traumatic experience.
For example, if you were in a car accident, you might stop driving.</li>
<li>Avoiding thoughts or feelings related to the traumatic event. For example, you might try
to stay very busy to try to avoid thinking about what happened.</li>
</ul><br>
<li>Arousal and reactivity symptoms, which may cause you to be jittery or be on the lookout
for danger. They include:</li>
<ul>
<li>Being easily startled</li>
<li>Feeling tense or "on edge"</li>
<li>Having difficulty sleeping </li>
<li>Having angry outbursts</li>
</ul><br>
<li>Cognition and mood symptoms, which are negative changes in beliefs and feelings. They include:</li>
<ul>
<li>Trouble remembering important things about the traumatic event</li>
<li>Negative thoughts about yourself or the world</li>
<li>Feeling blame and guilt</li>
<li>No longer being interested in things you enjoyed</li>
<li>Trouble concentrating</li>
</ul>
<p>The symptoms usually start soon after the traumatic event. But sometimes they may not
appear until months or years later. They also may come and go over many years. If your
symptoms last longer than four weeks, cause you great distress, or interfere with your work
or home life, you might have PTSD.</p>
