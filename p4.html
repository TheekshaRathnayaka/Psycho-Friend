<h2>Dissociative disorders</h2>
<p>Dissociative disorders are mental disorders that involve experiencing a disconnection and
lack of continuity between thoughts, memories, surroundings, actions and identity. People
with dissociative disorders escape reality in ways that are involuntary and unhealthy and
cause problems with functioning in everyday life.<br>
There are three major dissociative disorders:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Dissociative amnesia</b>- The main symptom is memory loss that's more severe than
normal forgetfulness and that can't be explained by a medical condition. You can't recall
information about yourself or events and people in your life, especially from a traumatic
time.</li><br>
<li><b>Dissociative identity disorder</b>- Formerly known as multiple personality disorder,
this disorder is characterized by "switching" to alternate identities. You may feel the
presence of two or more people talking or living inside your head, and you may feel as
though you're possessed by other identities. Each identity may have a unique name, personal
history and characteristics, including obvious differences in voice, gender, mannerisms and
even such physical qualities as the need for eyeglasses. There also are differences in how
familiar each identity is with the others.</li><br>
<li><b>Depersonalization-derealization disorder</b>- This involves an ongoing or episodic
sense of detachment or being outside yourself â€” observing your actions, feelings, thoughts
and self from a distance as though watching a movie (depersonalization). Other people and
things around you may feel detached and foggy or dreamlike, time may be slowed down or sped
up, and the world may seem unreal (derealization). You may experience depersonalization,
derealization or both.</li><br>
</ul>
<ul>
Signs and symptoms depend on the type of dissociative disorders you have, but may include:
<li>Memory loss (amnesia) of certain time periods, events, people and personal information</li>
<li>A sense of being detached from yourself and your emotions</li>
<li>A perception of the people and things around you as distorted and unreal</li>
<li>A blurred sense of identity</li>
<li>Significant stress or problems in your relationships, work or other important areas of your life</li>
<li>Inability to cope well with emotional or professional stress</li>
<li>Mental health problems, such as depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts and behaviors</li>
</ul>
<p>People who experience long-term physical, sexual or emotional abuse during childhood are
at greatest risk of developing dissociative disorders. Children and adults who experience
other traumatic events, such as war, natural disasters, kidnapping, torture, or extended,
traumatic, early-life medical procedures, also may develop these conditions.</p>

<h2>Eating disorders</h2>
<p>Eating disorders are serious mental health disorders. They involve severe problems with
your thoughts about food and your eating behaviors. You may eat much less or much more than
you need. Eating disorders are medical conditions, not a lifestyle choice. They affect your body's
ability to get proper nutrition. This can lead to health issues, such as heart and kidney
problems, or sometimes even death. But there are treatments that can help.<br>
Mainly there are three types of eating disorders.
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Binge-eating</b> - which is out-of-control eating. People with binge-eating disorder
keep eating even after they are full. They often eat until they feel very uncomfortable.</li><br>
<li><b>Bulimia nervosa</b> - People with bulimia nervosa also have periods of binge-eating.
But afterwards, they may over-exercise or fast.</li><br>
<li><b>Anorexia nervosa</b> - People with anorexia nervosa avoid food, or eat very small
quantities of only certain foods. They may see themselves as overweight, even when they are
dangerously underweight.</li>
</ul>
