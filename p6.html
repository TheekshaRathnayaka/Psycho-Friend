<h2>Personality disorders</h2>
<p>Personality disorders are a group of mental illnesses that involve long-term patterns of
thoughts and behaviors that are unhealthy and inflexible. The behaviors cause serious problems
with relationships and work. People with personality disorders have trouble dealing with
everyday stresses and problems. They often have stormy relationships with other people.<br>
The cause of personality disorders is unknown. However, genes, family backgrounds, and
childhood experiences may play a role. The symptoms of each personality disorder are
different. They can mild or severe. People with personality disorders may have trouble realizing
that they have a problem. To them, their thoughts are normal, and they often blame others
for their problems. They may try to get help because of their problems with relationships
and work. Treatment usually includes talk therapy and sometimes medicine.
