<h2>Phobias</h2>
<p>A phobia is a type of anxiety disorder. It is a strong, irrational fear of something that
poses little or no real danger. There are many specific phobias. Acrophobia is a fear of
heights. Agoraphobia is a fear of public places, and claustrophobia is a fear of closed-in
places. If you become anxious and extremely self-conscious in everyday social situations,
you could have a social phobia. Other common phobias involve tunnels, highway driving, water,
flying, animals and blood.</p>
<ul>People with phobias try to avoid what they are afraid of. If they cannot, they may experience:
<li>Panic and fear</li>
<li>Rapid heartbeat</li>
<li>Shortness of breath</li>
<li>Trembling</li>
<li>A strong desire to get away</li>
</ul>
<p>Phobias usually start in children or teens, and continue into adulthood. The causes of
specific phobias are not known, but they sometimes run in families. Treatment helps most
people with phobias. </p>

<p>Social anxiety disorder is a persistent and irrational fear of situations that may
involve scrutiny or judgment by others, such as at parties and other social events. People
with social anxiety disorder fear and avoid situations in which they may be judged by others.
It may begin in the teens and may have to do with overprotective parents or limited social
opportunities. Men and women are affected equally with this disorder. People with social
phobia are at high risk for alcohol or other drug use. This is because they may come to rely
on these substances to relax in social situations.</p>

<h2>Psychotic disorders</h2>
<p>Psychotic disorders are severe mental disorders that cause abnormal thinking and perceptions.
People with psychoses lose touch with reality. Two of the main symptoms are delusions and
hallucinations. Delusions are false beliefs, such as thinking that someone is plotting against
you or that the TV is sending you secret messages. Hallucinations are false perceptions,
such as hearing, seeing, or feeling something that is not there.<br>
Schizophrenia is one type of psychotic disorder. People with bipolar disorder may also have
psychotic symptoms. Other problems that can cause psychotic include alcohol and some drugs,
brain tumors, brain infections, and stroke.
