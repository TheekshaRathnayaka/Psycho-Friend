<h2>Sleep disorders</h2>
<p>Sleep disorders are conditions that disturb your normal sleep patterns. There are 
more than 80 different sleep disorders.</p>
<ul>

<li><b>Hypersomnia</b> - being unable to stay awake during the day. This includes narcolepsy, which causes extreme daytime sleepiness.</li>

<h2>Substance Use Disorder (SUD) </h2>
<p>Substance use disorder (SUD) is a complex condition in which there is uncontrolled use
 of a substance despite harmful consequences. People with SUD have an intense focus on 
using a certain substance(s) such as alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drugs, to the point where 
the person's ability to function in day-to-day life becomes impaired. People keep using the 
substance even when they know it is causing or will cause problems. The most severe SUDs 
are sometimes called addictions.<br>
People with a substance use disorder may have distorted thinking and behaviors. Changes 
in the brain's structure and function are what cause people to have intense cravings, 
changes in personality, abnormal movements, and other behaviors. Brain imaging studies 
show changes in the areas of the brain that relate to judgment, decision making, learning,
 memory, and behavioral control.</p>
<ul>According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, people begin taking drugs for a variety of reasons, including:
<li>To feel good — feeling of pleasure, “high” or "intoxication."</li>
<li>To feel better — relieve stress, forget problems, or feel numb.</li>
<li>To do better — improve performance or thinking.</li>
<li>Curiosity and peer pressure or experimenting.</li>
Symptoms of substance use disorder are scared and screaming from being drug and alcohol 
free, trembling, lying, behaving violently and forgetting.
