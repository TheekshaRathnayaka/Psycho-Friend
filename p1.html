<h2>Anxiety</h2>
<p>
Anxiety is a feeling of fear, dread, and uneasiness. It might cause you to sweat, feel
restless and tense, and have a rapid heartbeat. It can be a normal reaction to stress. For
example, you might feel anxious when faced with a difficult problem at work, before taking
a test, or before making an important decision. It can help you to cope. The anxiety may
give you a boost of energy or help you focus. But for people with anxiety disorders, the
fear is not temporary and can be overwhelming.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)</b> - People with GAD worry about ordinary issues
such as health, money, work, and family. But their worries are excessive, and they have them
almost every day for at least 6 months.</li><br>
<li><b>Panic disorder</b> - People with panic disorder have panic attacks. These are sudden,
repeated periods of intense fear when there is no danger. The attacks come on quickly and
can last several minutes or more.</li><br>
<li><b>Phobias</b> - People with phobias have an intense fear of something about spiders,
flying, going to crowded places, or being in social situations(known as social anxiety)</li>
</ul>
<p>They make you feel restless and tense and interfere with your daily life. They do not go
away and can get worse over time. Physical symptoms such as pounding,  rapid heartbeat,
unexplained aches and pains, dizziness and shortness of breath and changes in behavior,
such as avoiding everyday activities you used to do can be seen.</p>

<h2>Bipolar disorder</h2>
<p>
Most people feel sad or irritable from time to time. They may say they're in a bad mood.
A mood disorder is different. It affects a person's everyday emotional state. Nearly one in
ten people aged 18 and older have mood disorders. These include depression and bipolar disorder
(also called manic depression).
Mood disorders can increase a person's risk for heart disease, diabetes, and other diseases.
Treatments include medication, psychotherapy, or a combination of both. With treatment, most
people with mood disorders can lead productive lives.
Simply in bipolar disorder, mood swings from happy to sad and such mood last at least
one or two weeks. The exact cause of bipolar disorder is unknown. Several factors likely
play a role in the disorder. They include genetics, brain structure and function, and your
environment. You are at higher risk for bipolar disorder if you have a close relative who
has it. Going through trauma or stressful life events may raise this risk even more.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes you may feel extremely "up," elated, irritable, or energized. This is
called a <b>manic episode</b>.</li>
<li>Other times you may feel "down," sad, indifferent, or hopeless. This is called
a <b>depressive episode</b>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
The symptoms of a <b>manic episode</b> can include:<br><br>
<li>Feeling very up, high, or elated</li>
<li>Feeling jumpy, more active than usual</li>
<li>Having a very short temper or seeming extremely irritable</li>
<li>Needing less sleep</li>
<li>Do risky things that show poor judgment</li>
</ul>
<ul>
The symptoms of a <b>depressive episode</b> can include:<br><br>

<li>Lack of interest in your usual activities and being unable to do even simple things</li>

</ul>
<p>Treatment can help many people, including those with the most severe forms of bipolar
disorder. The main treatments for bipolar disorder include medicines, psychotherapy,
or both.</p>
